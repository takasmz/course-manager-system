## Course Objective
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This course is offered to students who have successfully completed Linear Algebra and Calculus. The purpose of the Probability and Statistics course is to develop the ability to think clearly, logically and critically within mathematical and non-mathematical situations. Students will acquire an understanding of probability and statistics through mathematical formulas, and the organization/examination of data. Students will apply probability and statistics concepts through class activities and projects. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probability and Statistics is an introduction to basic statistical concepts and techniques. Topics include descriptive statistics, probability theory, binomial distribution, normal distribution, sampling theory, hypothesis testing, confidence limits and ANOVA. Probability is the study of randomness and uncertainty. Statistics is the branch of mathematics that provides methods for organizing data, summarizing data and using information in the data to draw various conclusions. Learning probability and statistics concepts will enable the student to maximize his/her knowledge in uncertain situations by using and evaluating existing data or by collecting and analyzing his/her relevant data. 

## Assessment

|Assessment Methods or Approaches|Assessment Requirements|Assessment Weighting|Evaluation of Course Objectives|
|----|-------|------------|--------|
|classroom performance|attendance and so on|10%|   |	
|conventional assignments|15|30%|    |	
|final exam|Close-book|60%|   |	

Note: 
1Assessment methods or approaches mainly include classroom performance, conventional assignments, unit tests, mid-term exam, final exam, big assignments, course paper, project design and works, etc.
2Assessment requirements include frequencies of assignments, assessment methods (open-book, close-book), and project design requirements, etc.
3Assessment Weighting refers to the percentage that assessment methods or approaches take up in the total score.
