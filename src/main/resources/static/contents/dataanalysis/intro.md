## Course Objective
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this course is to enable the students to master the ability of data collection and statistical analysis for the data collected in the investigation by the basic theory and methods of data analysis on the basis of the basic course probability theory and mathematical statistics. Master the operation of professional statistical software SAS from the establishment of data files, basic analysis to the relevant regression analysis and multivariate analysis of the entire process of operation; to enable students to master a practical and highly professional skills; the same time to lay the foundations for other professional .
- To provide students with a good understanding of the concepts and methods of linear regression and multivariate statistical analysis, described in detail in the syllabus.
- To help the students to study large amounts of data in practical problems, and to make reasonable statistical inferences and make accurate forecasts from data.
- To help the students solve problem of random phenomena by using the basic principles of mathematical statistics, to explore the problems from multiple angles.
- To help the students to improve the ability of information access, information storage, information extraction and information application.

###Experimental Teaching Content
Data analysis experiments adhere to the "student-centered" principle, around the basic content of data analysis, so that students make full use of computer statistical software to experience and understand the basic concepts and conclusions of mathematics, so that students access to the use of computers to solve a variety of mathematical problems. Through the data analysis experiment, students should be able to independently and skillfully use the software for statistical calculations, so that theory is clear, hands-on, and write the experimental report. Teachers introduce a little thought, ask questions and tasks, and let the students try to discover and summarize the laws through their own hands and observe the experimental results.
