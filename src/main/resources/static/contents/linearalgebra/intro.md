## Course Objective
1. To provide students with a good understanding of the concepts and methods of linear algebra, described in detail in the syllabus.
2. To help the students develop the ability to solve problems using linear algebra.
3. To connect linear algebra to other fields both within and without mathematics.
4. To develop abstract and critical reasoning by studying logical proofs and the axiomatic method as applied to linear algebra
## Course Content
This is a 1-semester course in linear algebra for students who have completed two semesters of calculus. It covers Systems of Linear Equations and Matrices, Determinants, Vectors in 2-space and 3-space, Abstract Vector Spaces, Linear Transformations, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, and Inner Product Spaces. We will follow the textbook and aim to cover in full or in part the following chapters:
