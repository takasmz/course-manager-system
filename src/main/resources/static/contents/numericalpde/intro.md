## Course description
Numerical solution for PDEs is more exciting now than at almost any time in the past. Its applications continue to spread to more and more fields. Largely due to the computer revolution of the last half century, numerical methods has risen to a role of prominence in the mathematical curriculum rivaling that of calculus. Modern software has also made it possible to dramatically improve the way the course is taught.  It also introduces the basics of applied mathematics as well as a software package that is valuable both for learning and using numerical methods for PDEs. The main development of the course will follow the text 
## Course goals.
- To provide students with a good understanding of the concepts and methods of numerical solutions for PDEs, described in detail in the syllabus.
- To help the students develop the ability to solve problems using numerical solutions for PDEs.
- To connect numerical solutions for PDEs to other fields both within and without mathematics.
- To develop abstract and critical reasoning by studying logical proofs and the axiomatic method as applied to the numerical solutions for PDEs.

##Prerequisites
The main prerequisite for the course is that you understand the continuous problems for which numerical methods are developed. So you need to know ODEs and PDEs at the level taught in a methods of mathematical physics’s course and basic numerical analysis including programming.
